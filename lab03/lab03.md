first result it was giving a basic create characters for users. Couldn't choose name, stats, skills, equipment and class. that was was created from the AI.
the second result it was giving me the choice of creating my name, picking a class and picking two skills from five skills, but not my weapon.
the third result it giving me the choice of pulling anything for those options
the fourth result did not give me a choice at all for any of them.
the fifth result it was giving me a choice of default class with a race or pick your own class with a race. Then it created all the rest for me.
#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?
it did not work because it was giving prebuilt characters beside the class and race.
